# 🔢 **Number System Converter in JavaScript** 🌐

In this project, we will build a **Number System Converter** that can convert numbers between various number systems: **Decimal**, **Binary**, **Octal**, and **Hexadecimal**. This converter will allow the user to input a number in one system and see its corresponding value in the other number systems in real-time.

## 📝 **Prerequisites**:

To follow along with this project, you should have a basic understanding of:

- **HTML** 📄 (for structuring the converter)
- **CSS** 🎨 (for styling the page and making it visually appealing)
- **JavaScript** 💻 (for handling the logic of the number conversion)

You will also need:

- A text editor (e.g., **VSCode**) ✍️
- A web browser 🌐 to run the application

---

## 🚀 **Approach**:

### 1. **HTML Structure**:
- Create the basic structure for the number system converter using **HTML**. The structure will include:
  - Input field to enter the number
  - Dropdown menu to select the input number system (Decimal, Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal)
  - Result fields to display the converted number in other number systems (Decimal, Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal)
  - A form to handle the input and output dynamically.

### 2. **CSS Styling**:
- Use **CSS** to style the application and make it visually appealing.
  - Set appropriate margins, paddings, background colors, fonts, etc.
  - Make the form look neat and user-friendly.
  - Ensure the layout is responsive for all screen sizes.

### 3. **JavaScript Logic**:
- In **JavaScript**, write the logic for the conversion:
  - Create an **update function** that automatically updates the result fields whenever the user changes the input number or the selected number system.
  - Create a **reverse function** that will update the results when any of the output values are manually changed.
  - Use **DOM methods** like `document.getElementById`, `value`, and `innerText` to access the elements and update them with converted values.

### 4. **Conversion Logic**:
  - Implement logic to convert between the different number systems:
    - **Decimal to Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal**
    - **Binary to Decimal, Octal, Hexadecimal**
    - **Octal to Decimal, Binary, Hexadecimal**
    - **Hexadecimal to Decimal, Binary, Octal**

## 🌟 **Features**:

- **Real-time Conversion**: As the user enters a number and selects a number system, the results are displayed immediately.
  
- **Multiple Number Systems**: The converter supports conversions between Decimal, Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The design is simple and easy to understand, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced users.
